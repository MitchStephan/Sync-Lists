List of Classes and Major Chunks of Code Completed by SyncLists Team Members
============================================================================

- An entire Web API was written in Python using the Django web framework. It allows all
users, lists, and tasks to be modified via a RESTful API. Also, it allows for other API calls
such as login.

- A lot of client side (Java) code was written to support, parse, and interface with the web API. The total list
of classes include:
    
    + SyncListsApi.java
    + SyncListsAddSharedUserAsyncTask.java
    + SyncListsChangePasswordAsyncTask.java
    + SyncListsCreateListAsyncTask.java
    + SyncListsCreateTaskAsyncTask.java
    + SyncListsCreateUserAsyncTask.java
    + SyncListsDeleteListAsyncTask.java
    + SyncListsDeleteSharedUserAsyncTask.java
    + SyncListsDeleteTaskAsyncTask.java
    + SyncListsGetListAsyncTask.java
    + SyncListsGetListsAsyncTask.java
    + SyncListsGetTasksAsyncTask.java

    + SyncListsRequestAsyncTask.java
    + SyncListsRequestAsyncTaskCallback.java

    + SyncListsUpdateListAsyncTask.java
    + SyncListsUpdateSharingAsyncTask.java
    + SyncListsUpdateTaskAsyncTask.java
    + SyncListsUpdateUserAsyncTask.java

    + Constants.java
    + ListsActivity.java
    + SettingsActivity.java
    + SettingsArrayAdapter.java
    + SharedUsersArrayAdapter.java
