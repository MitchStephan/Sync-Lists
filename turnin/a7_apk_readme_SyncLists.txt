Dependencies
============
SyncLists requires an internet connection (otherwise it will give error messages).
It requires an internet connection because it needs to connect to the SyncLists servers
to authenticate you, as well as save your lists and tasks. Also, SyncLists requires
internet so that it can pull your previously saved lists and tasks. SyncLists will not work
without internet.
